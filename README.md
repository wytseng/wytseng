👋 Hi, I’m Stephanie

🏫 I graduated with a degree in Business Administration, but found a passion in coding. I have experience working as a web developer, and learned how to code in Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and Javascript through the work experience.

👀 I’m interested in learning more languages, and even touch upon data analysis. 

🌱 I’m currently refining and advance my knowledge in full-stack web development.

🧾 I’m currently job seeking!
