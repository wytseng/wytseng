👋 Hi, I’m Stephanie

🏫 I graduated with a degree in Business Administration, but found a passion for coding. I have experience working as a web developer at a start up for non-profits, and learned how to code in Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and Javascript through the work experience.

🌱 I’m currently working as a full-stack software engineer at Lumindate Data.
